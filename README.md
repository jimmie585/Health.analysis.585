# Health585
conducted EDA and visualization on patient health records using python .Implemented K-Means clustering to group patients based on key health indicators . Developed a KNN-based prediction model to identify patients at risk of certain diseases
Health Analysis: Clustering & Classification
1. Project Overview
This project explores health-related data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques. It applies K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify individuals based on health-related factors.

2. Dataset
Source: (Kaggle.)
Key Columns:
age â€“ Age of the individual
bmi â€“ Body Mass Index
blood_pressure â€“ Blood pressure level
cholesterol â€“ Cholesterol level
exercise_hours_per_week â€“ Average exercise hours per week
health_status â€“ Categorized as Healthy, At Risk, or Unhealthy
3. Tools & Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Jupyter Notebook for analysis
4. Project Workflow
âœ” Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, normalizing data
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identifying trends and correlations using visualizations
âœ” Clustering (K-Means) â€“ Grouping individuals based on health attributes
âœ” Classification (KNN) â€“ Predicting an individual's health status based on input features
âœ” Evaluation â€“ Assessing model performance using accuracy and visualization

5. Key Insights
ðŸ“Œ Individuals with high BMI and low exercise levels are more likely to be in the At Risk or Unhealthy category
ðŸ“Œ There is a strong correlation between high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure
ðŸ“Œ The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting health status


7. Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Include additional health factors such as dietary habits and sleep patterns
ðŸ”¹ Experiment with other classification models like Random Forest or SVM
ðŸ”¹ Develop a Streamlit dashboard for real-time health data visualization
